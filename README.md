## RenEVM

RenEVM is a fork of Go Ethereum (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) that makes use of Ren validators to secure the chain. This uses a modified version of the clique consensus algorithm that integrates with the Darknode Registry for determining validators.

This repository is a work in progress. The following is a list of things that still need to be done.

- Add snapshot mechanism for improved sync speeds.
- Add more tests.
- Add more documentation.
